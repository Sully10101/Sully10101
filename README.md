Journey to a career in PHP development...

Time to take the first step, let's see how long I can go. Back to basics first, I'll be using this to make notes & as a diary as I go.

Git CLI for beginners (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVsySz-h9r4)
GIT is a distributed version cntrl system (VCS), a centrl vcs is a repo located in one place if that goes down its boned unless backed up.
A distributed vcs means every developer can have pull a local copy of the repo.
Need to install git first, i know windows might not be the best OS for now but my endgoal is to create a windows automated ecommerce/laravel app so i'll stick to windows for now.
should probably install some basic apps too, don't even have notepad++ yet -__-
Gits installed, git version 2.31.1.windows.1
setting up the glb variables, 
git <verb> help (probably gonna need that)
cd to whereever, use mkdir <folder name> to create a directory/folder
