Journey to a career in PHP development (unless i make millions in crypto)...

Time to take the first step, let's see how long I can go. Back to basics first, I'll be using this to make notes & as a diary as I go.

Git CLI for beginners (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVsySz-h9r4)
GIT is a distributed version cntrl system (VCS), a centrl vcs is a repo located in one place if that goes down its boned unless backed up.
A distributed vcs means every developer can have pull a local copy of the repo.
Need to install git first, i know windows might not be the best OS for now but my endgoal is to create a windows automated ecommerce/laravel app so i'll stick to windows for now.
should probably install some basic apps too, don't even have notepad++ yet -__-
Gits installed, git version 2.31.1.windows.1
setting up the glb variables, 
git <verb> help (probably gonna need that)
cd to wherever, use mkdir <folder name> to create a directory/folder
create a basics folder and initialised with 'git init', that create a .git folder thing, this means git is tracking the dir where the .git is
deleting the .git = stop tracking
git status, shows nothing to track as nothing in folder
creating 2 files, 1 to track, 1 to ignore. 	
touch <'filename'.'ext'> creates a file, thats p cool
created 2 files, now need to create a .gitignore file for the ignoring bit, then open it with a txt editor. can use wildcards too (e.g *.png to ignore all png's) but for now ill just see if using the full file name works
it works, ignore.txt dosen't show when i run 'git status'
	
gonna call it a day, its 1am and i got work 2morrow
